          I am a Software Engineer at Cognizant Technology. I effortlessly
          switch between debugging code and curating the perfect travel
          itinerary. When I'm not optimizing algorithms, i'm scouting the latest
          fashion trends. My journey at Cognizant Technology Solutions evolved
          from crafting efficient web applications as a Programmer Analyst
          Trainee to engineering advanced, customer-centric projects as a
          Fullstack Software Engineer now. As a dynamic and innovative software
          engineer ps:a little bragging didn't harm anyone, I have made
          significant contributions to multiple projects in energy sector to
          banking clients constantly delivering high-quality results.
